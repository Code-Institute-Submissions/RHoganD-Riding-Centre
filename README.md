# The purpose with this project
The Riding Centre is a family business that loves horses and wants to encourage and share with the community who may not yet know anything about the horses and the gratifying experience that this represents.
This site will target individuals who have not yet tried to ride a horse and might be looking for information on how to book a riding session or learn how to ride a horse.
>Horses generate empathy with humans that other animals do not.
The live site can be found here -[link](https://rhogand.github.io/Riding-Centre/)
