# The purpose with this project
The Riding Centre is a family business that loves horses and wants to encourage and share with the community who may not yet know anything about the horses and the gratifying experience that this represents.
This site will target individuals who have not yet tried to ride a horse and might be looking for information on how to book a riding session or learn how to ride a horse.
>Horses generate empathy with humans that other animals do not.
The live site can be found here -[link](https://rhogand.github.io/Riding-Centre/)

# Design 

Some of the features of the design have been inspired by  The Love  Running Projects. The code for the footer and hero image has been taken from that project.
The scheme colour selected is based on the hero image. The scheme colour has a similarity to the colour found on the hero image and the logo. To create the website with a sense of harmony while navigating.
I have aimed to create a clean-looking website with a balance between colours, images and functionality.
