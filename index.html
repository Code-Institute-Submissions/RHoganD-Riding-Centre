        <h1>Welcome to The Riding Centre</h1>
        <p>The Horse Riding Centre was established in 2021, is a family owned and run British Horse Society approved riding school. Situated in Helensburgh overlooking the Firth of Clyde. We offer riding tuition for a wide range of ages and abilities and have a built indoor arena which allows us to function regardless of the Coast weather. Horses generate an empathy with humans that other animals do not. While many animals are well known for being therapeutic, horses are particularly well known for their ability to foster change.
